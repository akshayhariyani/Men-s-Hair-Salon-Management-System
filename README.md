## 📖 Overview

The **Men's Hair Salon Management System** is a complete software solution designed to streamline and digitize the daily operations of men's hair salons. Traditionally, salons rely on manual processes for appointment scheduling, inventory management, and payment handling—this can lead to inefficiencies and customer dissatisfaction.

This web-based system simplifies salon operations by automating key functions such as:

- 📅 Customer appointment bookings
- 💳 Membership management (Royal, Classic, Standard)
- 💇‍♂️ Service offerings (Haircuts, Beard Trims, Skin Treatments, Spa Services)
- 🧴 Inventory tracking (Haircare, Beardcare, Skincare products)
- 💰 Secure payment processing & transaction tracking

Developed using **PHP** and **MySQL**, the platform offers a responsive user interface to improve salon workflow and customer experience.
