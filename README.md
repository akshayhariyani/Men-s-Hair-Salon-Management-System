# 💈 Men's Hair Salon Management System

## 📖 Overview

The Men's Hair Salon Management System is a tailored software solution developed to modernize and automate the essential operations of a men's grooming salon. Salon management traditionally involves time-consuming manual processes like booking appointments, managing service offerings, maintaining inventory, and handling payments often leading to inefficiencies, errors, and poor customer experiences.

This web-based system simplifies salon operations by automating key functions such as:

- 📅 Customer appointment bookings
- 💳 Membership management (Royal, Classic, Standard)
- 💇‍♂️ Service offerings (Haircuts, Beard Trims, Skin Treatments, Spa Services)
- 🧴 Inventory tracking (Haircare, Beardcare, Skincare products)
- 💰 Secure payment processing & transaction tracking

Built using PHP and MySQL, the system offers a user-friendly interface that improves operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
